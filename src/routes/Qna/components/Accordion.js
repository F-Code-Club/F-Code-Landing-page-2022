                            F-Code is a community of students who share common IT habits and want to
                            share and learn. We encourage students to participate if your department
                            is Information Technology

                            English is the key to unlocking new opportunities. The majority of good
                            IT materials are written in English. As a result, we recommend that you
                            try to improve your English skills in order to have access to more
                            information.
